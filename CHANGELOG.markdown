Release history
---------------

Releases are save compatible across patch releases for a given minor version. For instance 1.0.0,
1.2.1, and 1.2.4 would all be save compatible with one another.

[editorial]: Editorial.markdown

### 1.0

#### 1.1.0-dev (in development)

- Allow AI Deseret and AI United States to keep a theocratic government ([#109]). Also add a flag
  for theocratic United States.
- Normalise the *Restore America* CB as it had too many quirks and was incomplete in some respects.
  It now behaves more closely to a unification CB (without the requirement of being a Great Power).
  This normalisation includes providing a separate CB for annexation purposes.
- Only allow the *Revoke Kurdish Autonomy* decision to be taken after the conclusion of *the Rise of
  Bedr Khan* chain. This prevents the Ottoman Empire wrongly returning Persian cores it might have
  acquired through other means. In addition, the decision now requires 50% Westernisation progress
  instead of 25% (this matches the unfinished 1.28 HFM branch).
- Correct the transfer of Natalia cores at the conclusion of *the Battle of Blood River*. This
  ensures the country makes an appearance in most playthroughs, and makes it playable without having
  to jump through too many hoops.
- Restore missing international migration attraction during the *Witwatersrand Gold Rush* (part of
  [#121]).

#### 1.0.0

The first public release, it is based on [HFM 1.27I][]. It is **not** backward compatible with it.

It also includes the colonial de-railroading system first seen in PR [HFM/#157] (later the basis for
[HFM Derailroaded][]) though the option has been flipped around: the additional historical colonial
conquest events are *disabled* by default, and there is the option to enable it.

We realise this last change is opinionated and that many users would prefer the other default. A
system for customising defaults is planned, but did not make the cut for 1.0.

##### Flagship Features & Bug Fixes

- Leaders now display their personality & background all at once, together with a stat summary with
  highlights. This makes it vastly easier for the player to figure out at a glance how good or bad a
  leader is:

  <figure>

    <figcaption>

    Selecting a general for Austria’s third army from among many candidates. From higher up to lower
    down the list, some of the leaders that stand out:

    - Alois von Grünne: the speediest hellbent armchair general there is with +50% speed
    - Werner von Hötzendorf: a decent all-rounder with +2 attack +1 defence and a little bit extra
      as indicated by the green ‘?’ question mark (in his case, a small bonus to morale)
    - Alfons Remmele (highlighted, with tooltip): this defiant cartographer is an ever present rock
      at +3 defence and +40% speed, with some extras (in this case, small bonuses to morale and
      organisation)
    - Ludwig Held (immediately after Alois Eisner, name hidden): while he could be considered for
      the post for defence, he should not be employed on the offence due to a disappointing -2
      attack

    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  (Details further below.)

- Port the dismantlement system from HPM 0.4.5. In order to make this work, a couple other
  supporting features have also been ported—these are described separately.

  The dismantlement system is a great tool to transform a *good* campaign into a **great** campaign
  in the later parts of the game, or just to put the finishing touches on your favourite project.
  Unfortunately the version used by HFM was showing its age, and came with very frustrating
  drawbacks:

  * Unreliability: players had little to no control over who benefits from the spoils of
    dismantlement, in what order. A dismantling country might be offered worthless land at high
    infamy costs before even receiving a proposal for a valuable possession.
  * Unreliability again, but in the colonies: the system handed out colonial provinces at the region
    level. This compounds with the previous point: countries would take random turns to receive
    random regions. The results were rarely pretty.
  * Incompleteness: some parts of the world were not covered at all. India and Indonesia are the two
    big standouts in this respect, often ending safely independent despite being prized colonial
    possessions.

  HPM improves on all these points from 0.4 on:

  * Improved control: countries that have lost a war in the past 5 years are excluded from receiving
    spoils of dismantlement. Infamy costs are scaled to population.
  * Integration with the colonial organisation system means that most colonial possessions are now
    handed out on a country scale rather than piecemeal. Colonial masters get special access to
    recover their claims during dismantlement (e.g. completing their possessions in Nigeria), but
    only if they are at peace.
  * Regions which haven’t been claimed or cannot be claimed are handed out piecemeal, same as
    before.
  * For dismantled claims (e.g. a dismantled United Kingdom being forced to relinquish British
    Nigeria) a priority system gives first pick to eligible *player* Great Powers, followed by *AI*
    Great Powers, and finally secondary powers. Vassal countries are excluded (modulo pending
    [HPM/#133], rarely and with limited impact).
  * Colonial Indonesia is now part of the colonial system, and gets handed out as such during
    dismantlement. India also gets handed out as a whole and Indian puppets will gradually shift
    their allegiance to the new colonial overlord, if there is any.

  [HPM/#133]: https://github.com/arkhometha/Historical-Project-Mod/issues/133

- Some infamous decisions had incorrectly set up conditions, ruining performance when AI countries
  would endlessly activate them. They have been fixed and are briefly listed here, with more details
  at their respective individual entries:

  - *Italia Irredenta*
  - *AI: Call Allies to War* (when AI United Kingdom calls its puppets into a war)
  - *Occupation of the Congo Basin*
  - *Establish the Karafuto Prefecture*

##### Features

- Leader stat summary explained. It consists of the following, with appropriate colour coding:

  <figure>

    ![General stat summary][general-stat-summary]

    [general-stat-summary]:
      media/stat-summary.png?raw=true
      "The statistics of two generals from the Austrian officer corps"

    <figcaption>

    **attack score, defence score, speed modifier, extras**
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  Extras, if present, denote one or two remarkable modifier to organisation and/or morale—think of
  it as a tiebreaker for generals with otherwise similar stats. Leader prestige, indicated by the
  column to the left of the portrait, plays a similar role. Extras are displayed as one of the
  following from best to worst: ‘!!!’, ‘?’, blank when unremarkable, ‘¿’, ‘¡¡¡’.

  A stat is displayed as blank when neutral (e.g. no bonus to attack, no speed modifier) or
  unremarkable. Great care has been taken that stat summaries have pixel-perfect alignment with one
  another at all times in the leader selection panel, and you can think of all aggregate stats as
  being displayed in columns (e.g. for attack) as well as in leader rows.

  This change has been achieved by storing the formerly separate personalities & backgrounds of
  leaders as a single trait under the hood, which acts as a combination of the two. This does *not*
  affect how powerful generals or admirals can be, or how unlikely it is to roll e.g. a +5 attack/+5
  defence general.

  Known limitations include:
  - An inability to sort leaders in any useful order when clicking on the “Personality & Background”
    column header. Unfortunately this appears to be a base game limitation.
  - The leader list in the military country screen “leaks” tooltips to the areas just under it. This
    is a little bit disorientating when trying to use the UI elements in this area: the Create
    General/Admiral buttons, as well as the leader management checkboxes. This however doesn’t
    prevent their normal use or displaying their own tooltips. This also appears to be a base game
    limitation, when trying to fit the longer unified trait descriptions in the leader list.

  Note that **morale**, a normally unremarkable stat, is being accounted for in the extras due to
  the weight that the game puts on it. It is suspected though not known for sure that high morale
  general tends to take over their otherwise comparable colleagues when merging armies together, or
  even worse when joining a battle.

- Ported dismantlement system details. It is based on HPM 0.4.5.2, but also includes the following
  later fixes:

  * Part of [HPM/104f7a31]:
    > * Increased Infamy from fighting colonies that refuse to submit during a dismantlement. It can
    >   go now up to an additional 5, depending on how bit the colony is.
    > * NNM distribution of colonies during dismantlement should now avoid countries that already
    >   refused to get more colonies.
    > * Ottoman dismantlement will now try to give Montenegro and Serbia their cores back,
    >   regardless of truce, and first. That way the region doesn't end controlled by
    >   Bosnia/Albania. Greece can also get their cores back regardless of truce IF they are not a
    >   SP/GP or if their sphere master/overlord has a truce with the Ottomans.

  * Part of [HPM/a9984f5]:
    > * Another attempt at trying to stop the dismantlement event from happening over and over if
    >   you already decided to not take part anymore. Please let me know if the problem still pops
    >   up.

    [HPM/a9984f5]: https://github.com/arkhometha/Historical-Project-Mod/commit/a9984f55990ab54124f0550170ce170a9e92b2e4
  * Part of [HPM/7aab423e]:
    > * Fixed NNM event 96065 that could give a dismantle nation CB on a nation you have a truce
    >   with.

    [HPM/7aab423e]: https://github.com/arkhometha/Historical-Project-Mod/commit/7aab423e9f38d9d5f8d5a957a83532d866d473d2
  * Part of [HPM/1209fbbf] (undocumented).

    [HPM/1209fbbf]: https://github.com/arkhometha/Historical-Project-Mod/commit/1209fbbf169fd797749b6e2af060348f5caf1982

- Port the starting year for unlocking Great Wars from HPM: 1890 (same as unmodded), instead of 1900
  previously. The starting year for World Wars is still 1905, unchanged from both HPM and
  previously.

  This is done in support for the dismantlement system even though it is not part of it, since the
  dismantlement CB can only be used after discovering Mass Politics no earlier than 1900 anyway.
  However the ten-year lag between the two mods was being felt acutely when it comes to the power
  dynamics of the second half of a full campaign.

  Moving up the earliest unlock date makes room for about one extra (dismantlement-less) Great War.
  This can allow a crafty diplomat to set the stage for momentous dismantlements later down the
  line, but requires either skill or luck.

- **(Experimental)** Turn the *Restore Democracy in South America* decision into a casus belli. As a
  decision, it had several flaws:

  - It had a hidden infamy cost.
  - Its requirement were not strict enough, leading to unintended wars e.g. against a communist
    European power with land in South America.
  - Even if the above were taken care of, a decision cannot accurately check that all conditions for
    a valid war are met. This is generally the case for all decisions or events that start wars, but
    is more prominent for a decision that is not a one-shot button.
  - The communist defender of the war received a free *Make Puppet* counter-CB. This lead to all
    kinds of oddities.

  The intent behind the decision is better reflected as a proper casus belli. This change is still
  labelled as experimental because it does get rid of the counter-CB of the original approach
  altogether. As a result communist governements in South America are in perpetual danger from their
  democratic neighbours.

##### Ported Features

- Port the colonial organisation system from HPM 0.4.5 and later to support the ported dismantlement
  system. This is ***not*** the colonial casus belli system with reworked Scramble for Africa.

  As a colonial conqueror from outside Africa, you could already supersede and organise native
  countries into a colonial country that takes on your primary culture and state religion. Changes &
  new features include:

  * There is now a colonial country for nearly every part of sub-Saharan Africa. This includes the
    addition of colonial country Ghana, separate from native country Ashanti which used to pull
    double duties.

  * Other countries outside of Africa that can also be organised (though not always as a colonial
    country) include:

    - Indonesia (not new)
    - Timor
    - Lebanon

  * Re-evaluated colonial organisation conditions. Relative to the older system organisation is a
    little more free-form now, typically requiring control of half the states that make up a
    colonial country. In comparison the older system normally required control of set key provinces.

    Likewise whereas the older system required 1870 culture tech *Revolution & Counterrevolution*,
    organisation now requires 1870 army tech *Machine Guns* and 1850 commerce tech *Market
    Regulations*.

  * Re-evaluated colonial organisation RGOs. Quoting from the 0.4 HPM patch notes:

    > * "Organizing Colony" decisions now need Machine Guns and Market Regulations. They also will
    >   change a few RGOs to cash-crop/mining RGOs, making the decisions more worthwhile. Reduced the
    >   number of cash crops/mining operations in African uncivs and moved them to the "organize"
    >   decisions—these nations were more focused on subsistence than export-economy.
    > * Nigeria RGOs redone. The source is (An Economic History of Nigeria 186o-196o Sahistory.org.za
    >   uploads /r._olufemi_ekundare_an_economic_history_of_nigerbook4you.org_.pdf )
    > * South Africa got a few more iron and coal provinces. Mostly based on Saimm.co.za and
    >   Isc.hbs.edu Africa_Iron Ore_2013.pdf
    > * Indonesia got a few iron provinces that will appear later. Based on Aig.org.au the history of
    >   coal development in indonesia.pdf
    > * Mauritania gets an iron province in the north.
    > * Senegal gets a few cotton provinces. Saint-Louis changed to cotton. Source: Persee.fr pp303
    >   and "La crise trentenaire de l’économie arachidière" by Mohamed Mbodj pp3
    > * Upper Volta will produce cotton in the south. Diversified starting RGOs a bit (previously it
    >   was only grain). Based on Icac.org and Lefaso.net
    > * Mali will now produce cotton in the south. Diversified starting RGOs and made sure cattle is
    >   in the cattle zone while fruits/grain start in the south. They will no longer start producing
    >   cotton either. Based on Fews.net copy.jpg?itok=NA3ukgKa and Haskovi.org

    >   production while the north has cotton and rubber. Based on Legacy.lib.utexas.edu and
    >   Horizon.documentation.ird.fr
    > * Sierra Leone gets Coffee in Freetown after they are organized. Based on Universityofmakeni.com
    > * Guinea has an economy focusing on Rubber. Other productions are fruit (bananas) and a gold
    >   mine. Source: Persee.fr
    > * The Gambia is unchanged, as it exported groundnuts for most of its history. Source
    >   Stclements.edu
    > * When Guinea-Bissau is organized they will export timber and rubber. Based on En.wikipedia.org
    > * Niger, when organized, gets a 2 cotton producing provinces. Based on Persee.fr and Persee.fr
    >   and en.wikipedia.org

    Because the player debt system of HPM was *not* ported, players should take note that they
    should probably have enough treasury reserves on hand before undertaking the following lucrative
    investments:

    | Country | Maximum cost |
    | -------:|:------------ |
    Nigeria | £200k
    Indonesia | £200k
    Sierra Leone | £100k
    Zambia | £100k
    Mali | £100k
    Sudan | £100k

    These amounts are displayed as reminders in the description of their respective colonial
    organisation decision, before the player is presented with a final choice to make.

    Other colonial RGO decisions have been brought closer in line to HPM in terms of requirements
    (but rarely effects). This was done for consistency e.g. in the amount of importance that these
    decisions lend to economic techs, and include:

    - *Economic Reforms in the Uzbek Homeland*
    - *Economic Reforms in the Kyrgyz Homeland*
    - *Economic Reforms in the Turkmen Homeland*
    - *Economic Reforms in the Tajik Homeland*
    - *Economic Reforms in the Philippines*
    - *An End to Natural Dyes?*

  Includes fixes to restore parity between player and AI countries (pending [HPM/#235]).

  [HPM/#235]: https://github.com/arkhometha/Historical-Project-Mod/pull/235

- Port the decision organisation & de-clutter system from HPM 0.4.5 and later. Includes some fixes
  (pending [HPM/#237]).

  [HPM/#237]: https://github.com/arkhometha/Historical-Project-Mod/pull/237

- Port the *Disable Trade Policy Decisions* option decision: turn off the recurring trade policy
  decisions from the start.

- To support the ported colonial organisation system from HPM, crises now follow the rules of HPM
  0.4.5 and later. They are unlocked after a country researches *Revolution & Counterrevolution* and
  after **1886**, to avoid interfering with the Scramble for Africa.

  Players have access to a new option decision to go by the previous rule: crises unlock as soon as
  a country researches *Revolution & Counterrevolution*. There is still also the option to unlock
  crises from the start.

- Port the additional text colours of HPM ([HPM/#163]). Also port the colour hints that improve the
  readability of e.g. decision condition tooltips.

  [HPM/#163]: https://github.com/arkhometha/Historical-Project-Mod/pull/163

##### Changes

- Control over the *Splendid Isolation* diplomatic policy of the United Kingdom is now done through
  an option decision. The policy is active by default, and the option disables it.

##### Bug fixes

- Add a guard condition to the *Establish the Karafuto Prefecture* decision ([#28]).

  [#28]: https://github.com/moretrim/ccHFM/pull/28

- Leave Ryukyu independent during Meiji Restoration ([#51]).

  [#51]: https://github.com/moretrim/ccHFM/pull/51

- Prevent the Papal States (aka Lazio aka the Roman Republic) from being outright annexed when Italy
  forms by event (*Il Risorgimento*). They instead get a say into the matter, and can challenge
  Italy ([#19], [HPM/#3] + [HPM/93c5ca]).

  [#19]: https://github.com/moretrim/ccHFM/issues/19
  [HPM/#3]: https://github.com/arkhometha/Historical-Project-Mod/pull/3
  [HPM/93c5ca]: https://github.com/arkhometha/Historical-Project-Mod/commit/93c5ca17481d738a3dba84581be258b28343ffda

- Preserve the state religion of the Heavenly Kingdom upon Westernisation ([#40]).

  [#40]: https://github.com/moretrim/ccHFM/issues/40

- Remove correct Basotho cores in Mfecane Matabele ([HPM/#131]).

  [HPM/#131]: https://github.com/arkhometha/Historical-Project-Mod/pull/131

- Correct requirements of the *Occupation of the Congo Basin* decision, resolving ineffective use
  ([#26]).

  [#26]: https://github.com/moretrim/ccHFM/issues/26

  In addition, the decision has been relaxed and no longer requires that the occupying power be a
  Great Power. This constraint was too strict, regularly leading to games where the country in
  control of the lower Congo (often Spain or Portugal) would never come close to being a GP. This
  would leave a large empty streak of uncontrolled land in the middle of Africa.

  There is no longer a rank requirement. To prevent the colonial power immediately gaining control
  of all Chad lands, Ubangi-shari and Waddai are now only available after 1890 and 1895
  respectively. This roughly matches historical dates. (#86)

  [#86]: https://github.com/moretrim/ccHFM/issues/86

- Really release Ezo when choosing to play as them ([HPM/#161]).

  [HPM/#161]: https://github.com/arkhometha/Historical-Project-Mod/pull/161

- Fixes to the *Annex Korea* decision, aiming to resolve the following two situations (pending
  [HPM/#189]):
  * late game liberation crises that would fizzle when going to war over Korea
  * Japanese conquest of Korea against the player

  [HPM/#189]: https://github.com/arkhometha/Historical-Project-Mod/pull/189

- Improve the Boer War call to arms to be infamy neutral (it was deducting 3 extra), and make it AI
  only. The player now gets notified of the new alliance.

- Prevent follow-up event to *The Mysterious Lands of Guatemala* archaeological chain from granting
  prestige to non-existing countries ([8c3aa2]).

  [8c3aa2]: https://github.com/moretrim/ccHFM/commit/8c3aa2bed5bebfb7369cc7c5f7836304edf79a85

- Extend player protection of Neuchâtel crisis ([#76]). Note that there still are extant
  event-driven annexations of Neuchâtel, and as such it should still be considered a hard start for
  advanced players.

  [#76]: https://github.com/moretrim/ccHFM/issues/76

- Correct condition on the *Colonial Incorporation* event for Western Sahara. The event incorrectly
  happened for African countries other than Morocco.

- Colonial de-railroading: cherry-pick [off-the-rails/#3], restoring parity with [HFM
  Derailroaded][].

  [off-the-rails/#3]: https://github.com/addonovan/off-the-rails/pull/3

- Colonial de-railroading: change the default behaviour to disabled, with the option to re-enable.

- Add 31 days of cooldown to *AI: Call Allies to War* (when AI United Kingdom is at war) in certain
  circumstances. This is to prevent adverse impact on performance, without hindering British
  military power too much. There is no cooldown when performance cannot be affected.

- Add a name and improved information to call-to-arms wars. They will now be called e.g. *7th
  British Call to Arms* while the associated casus belli sports a more fitting icon. A missing
  translation string in the description of the latter has also been added.

  These wars used to fall back to a generic name e.g. *7th War of British Aggression*. Combined with
  their unusual appearance this made them rather confusing at first glance. (Call to arms have no
  actual defender and feature the placeholder rebel flag on that side.)

- Simplify *Italia Irredenta*. The decision has an over-complicated design, leading to two flaws:

  * Non obvious hidden conditions, potentially confusing the player as to when the decision is
    available, and for which purpose.
  * Conditions & effects were out of sync. In some circumstances, this led to Italy repeatedly
    activating the decision with ruinous consequences on game performance.

  The simplification only mitigates the latter aspect by turning the decision into a more typical
  claiming button—though with multiple stages same as before. A knock-on consequence is that the
  decision is now somewhat less powerful than before, though some of the things it allowed before
  (e.g. granting claims while at war) were of dubious value.

  The decision might be revisited again in the future ([#39]).

  [#39]: https://github.com/moretrim/ccHFM/issues/39

- Prevent French countries other than France from accessing or benefiting from decisions, events,
  and other effects meant to be exclusive to France (part of [#87]).

  [#87]: https://github.com/moretrim/ccHFM/issues/87

- Prevent the Arab Union (which acts as a quasi-cultural union) from losing Mashriqi culture from
  independence movements (pending [HPM/#236]).

  [HPM/#236]: https://github.com/arkhometha/Historical-Project-Mod/issues/236

- Give more robust port requirements to casus belli. This sidesteps a quirk of the game which appears to
  rely on pathfinding to count ports in a country—resulting in inconsistent results when ongoing
  sieges (not occupations!) block off path computations. (Documented at [HPM/#114].)

  While the quirk also affects other things, reducing the frequency of CB invalidation was given
  priority.

  [HPM/#114]: https://github.com/arkhometha/Historical-Project-Mod/issues/114
