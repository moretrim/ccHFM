cch.deria-dowlat.name;The Fate of the Deria Dowlat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.deria-dowlat.desc;In 1836 the Madras ship Deria Dowlat, sailing under British colours, was brutally plundered. Carrying a number of pilgrims and cargo bound for Jeddah, she had run aground a short distance from Aden. Shortly afterwards, she was boarded and plundered by tribesmen from Lahej. The innocent passengers were subjected to the cruellest of atrocities, and were only saved from permanent subjugation by the intervention of one of Aden's most influential families. The stolen cargo has since been sold in the public market. Attempts to negotiate recompense have been met with attempted treachery by the Sultan's son. This outrage demands recompense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.deria-dowlat.opta;We need only offer stipends to convince the Sultans to defend our interests;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.deria-dowlat-diplo.name;The British ship Deria Dowlat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.deria-dowlat-diplo.desc;The British have complained about the ill treatment of travelers on one of their ships that recently wrecked on our coast. While we intervened as soon as possible to rescue the travelers, the British would prefer to see us intervene sooner. The matter has not been helped by an incident where a British negotiator has accused the Sultan's son of treachery. They have asked for recompense, but they have also offered a stipend for us to defend their travelers from tribesmen. It has been clear for a long time that the British have been searching for a pretext to take Aden from us, but they fear the cost of defending themselves against raids by the tribesmen. Perhaps this is a compromise that we should consider?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.deria-dowlat-diplo.opta;We agree to this payment and to better relations with the British;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.deria-dowlat-diplo.optb;British scum! Begone in your leaky boats!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.deria-dowlat-diplo-agreed.name;The Sultan in Aden has agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.deria-dowlat-diplo-agreed.desc;The Sultan controlling Aden has agreed to our generous stipend, in exchange for the security of our travelers in his lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.deria-dowlat-diplo-agreed.opta;Splendid!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.deria-dowlat-diplo-denied.name;The Sultan in Aden rejects our offer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.deria-dowlat-diplo-denied.desc;The Sultan controlling Aden has insulted our diplomats and rejects our offer of a more than generous stipend! It is clear that he condones the vile acts of his son and the thieving tribesmen of his land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.deria-dowlat-diplo-denied.opta;To war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.deria-dowlat-diplo-denied.optb;We will prepare for war;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.raids-from-fadhli.name;Raids from Fadhli tribesmen;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.raids-from-fadhli.desc;Tribesmen from the interior, especially from Fadhli, continue to plague us with raids upon Aden and upon travelers. We can do little to stop this, and war with Fadhli would be risky. Last year, we asked the conniving British to help us against these raids, but they refused. Instead, the British expressed desire to survey our coast, no doubt with avarice in their hearts;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.raids-from-fadhli.opta;Such misfortune!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.raids-from-fadhli-stop.name;Raids from Fadhli tribesmen stop;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.raids-from-fadhli-stop.desc;The raids upon Aden from the Yemeni interior have finally reduced to a a manageable level!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.raids-from-fadhli-stop.opta;Joyous day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.raiding-aden;Raiding Aden;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.raiding-aden_desc;Continues indefinitely, until Fadhli stops or is forced to stop;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.fadhli-raids;Fadhli raids;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.raid-aden.name;Raiding Aden;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.raid-aden.desc;The people of Fadhli are strong and independent. Raiding is part of our culture. We have traditionally fought our neighbors, but Aden in particular is a fine target. It is a trade hub that often possesses rare and valuable goods, and it struggles against our might.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.raid-aden.opta;We are strong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.raiding-aden;Occasionally raiding Aden;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.punish-fadhli_title;Punish Fadhli;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.punish-fadhli_desc;Tribes in Fadhli have been a nuisance for far too long, constantly raiding Aden and harassing trade. Recently, the Sultan Ahmad ibn `Abd Allah al-Fadli has become even more belligerent, rendering the situation intolerable. It is time to show him that our military might can extend well into his lands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.fadhli-punished;We have been punished for our raids of Aden;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.nice-fadhli_title;Stopping raids on Aden;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.nice-fadhli_desc;The world has changed, and so must we. As western cultures influence us, we have started to perceive their true military might. While we adapt to this new situation, we must put aside our traditional raiding. This must be done, even if many tribesmen will not understand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.kathiri-quaiti-conflict.name;The Kathiri-Qu'aiti conflict;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.kathiri-quaiti-conflict.desc;The Qu'aiti Sultanate gradually conquered most of the area once controlled by Kathiri Sultanate, starting in 1858. This prolonged conflict eventually resulted in a reduction of Kathiri territory to a relatively small inland area including Say'un. The Kathiris petitioned the British to intervene, to no avail. Back and forth conflict continued for decades, beyond even the formation of the Aden Protectorate. The conflict was finally resolved in 1918, when the Kathiri agreed to settle future disputes through outside arbitration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.kathiri-quaiti-conflict.opta;Such misfortune!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.kathiri-quaiti-conflict;Kathiri-Qu'aiti Conflict;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.offer-informal-protection-yemeni_title;Informal protection of the Yemeni sultanates;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.offer-informal-protection-yemeni_desc;Diplomacy in the southern portion of Arabia, near the Aden trading hub, is a difficult matter. The various sultanates are ever in conflict, and the lack of centralized rule renders the area frequently treacherous. We may be able to simplify this situation by offering informal protection and stipends to prominent leaders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.pestered-yemen;Pestering a Yemeni tag to join accept our informal protection;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.agree-informal-protection.name;Informal protection;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.agree-informal-protection.desc;Great powers have been been expanding their influence in the Arabian Peninsula. If we agree to informal protection, it may be a step towards losing our independence, but it should prevent forceful incursion by another, less agreeable nation into our territory. If we say no, some great power will most likely find a flimsy pretext to attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.agree-informal-protection.opta;Agree to informal protection;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.informal-protection-yes.name;Offer of informal protection;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.informal-protection-yes.desc;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to our offer of protection!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

cch.informal-protection-no.opta;How unwise of them;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.negotiate-aden-protectorate.name;Negotiation of the Aden Protectorate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.negotiate-aden-protectorate.desc;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has asked us to become part of a unified protectorate to be governed from Aden. This may reduce the frustrations of diplomacy with our protector nation, but we doubt that it will solve all diplomatic issues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.negotiate-aden-protectorate.opta;Agree to the proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.negotiate-aden-protectorate.optb;Reject the proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;

cch.yemen-rejection.opta;The fools!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.socotra-purchase_title;The Socotra Purchase;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.socotra-purchase_desc;We have needed a coaling station on or near the southern Arabian Peninsula for our ships for some time now. The Arabian coast is also perilous territory for any civilian ships in distress. Socotra would be an ideal location for a coaling station, but Sultan Amr bin Saad Tawari of Mahra had previously refused to sell or lease part of it to us. Now there is a new sultan in charge of the area. Perhaps he will be more amenable to our offer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.tried-socotra-purchase;We are trying to purchase Socotra from Mahra;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.mahra-socotra-purchase.name;The Socotra Purchase;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.mahra-socotra-purchase.desc;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has offered to purchase Socotra, our rightful land, so that they can store coal for their ships. They may be willing to negotiate the lease of a small part of the island instead. We must decide if we are willing to cede part of our land for security, or if we want to deal with $FROMCOUNTRY$ at all. If we refuse, they may find some excuse to attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.socotra-purchase.opta;Sell the island;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.socotra-purchase.optb;Lease a small portion of Socotra as a coaling station;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.socotra-purchase.optc;Refuse to negotiate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.mahra-socotra-purchase-yes.desc;The Sultan has agreed to our full offer to purchase Socotra!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.mahra-socotra-purchase-yes.opta;Splendid!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.mahra-socotra-purchase-lease.desc;The Sultan refuses to sell Socotra, but has agreed to lease a portion of it as a coaling station.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.mahra-socotra-purchase-lease.opta;This will have to suffice;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.mahra-socotra-purchase-no.desc;The Sultan refuses to lease even part of the island! This is unreasonable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.mahra-socotra-purchase-no.opta;Prepare for war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.attempted-yemen;Attempting to form the Aden Protectorate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.accepted-yemen;Wishes to join the Aden Protectorate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.rejected-yemen;Refuses to join the Aden Protectorate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.kathiri-quaiti-conflict-ends.name;End of the Kathiri-Qu'aiti Conflict;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.kathiri-quaiti-conflict-ends.desc;The conflict between the Qu'aiti Sultanate and the Kathiri Sultanate had been ongoing in the Hadhramaut region of the southern Arabian Peninsula for decades. A settlement has finally been reached between the two parties, who have agreed to resolve future disputes through arbitration. This should greatly improve stability and quality of life in Mukalla province, especially.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.kathiri-quaiti-conflict-ends.opta;May peace prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.petition-for-yemen_title;Petition to join Yemen;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.finalize-aden-protectorate_title;Form the Aden Protectorate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.finalize-aden-protectorate_desc;Beginning with a formal treaty of protection with the Mahra Sultanate of Qishn and Socotra in $YEAR$, $COUNTRY$ embarked on a slow progression of protection arrangements that included over 30 major treaties of protection. These treaties, together with a number of other minor agreements, created the Aden Protectorate that extends well east of Aden to Hadhramaut except for the immediate environs and port of the colonial capital, Aden. In exchange for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ protection, the rulers of the constituent territories of the Protectorate agreed not to enter into treaties with or cede territory to any other foreign power. For administrative purposes, the protectorate was informally divided into the Eastern Protectorate (with its own Political Officer, a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ advisor, stationed at Mukalla in Qu'aiti) and the Western Protectorate (with its own Political Officer, stationed at Lahej), for some separation of administration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.petition-for-yemen_desc;When the Aden Protectorate was formed, we believed that our best options lied elsewhere, either as part of the Protectorate of South Arabia, or on our own. To our surprise, Yemen has thrived, and we now wish to join.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.petition-yemen.name;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has petitioned to join us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.petition-yemen.desc;Even though $FROMCOUNTRY$ previously refused us when the Aden Protectorate was formed, it is now clear that joining us is the best option. Indeed, their lack of decisiveneness has always been well-known, and it is better for them to let others make important decisions for them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.petition-yemen.opta;We welcome them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.yemen-take-this_title;A gift to our friends in Aden;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.yemen-take-this_desc;Aden and the Yemeni have prospered in our sphere. They are now truly our respected allies, and we trust them to administer the lands of the various Yemeni tribes. This should render the area more stable, and it will strengthen our allies in Aden.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.gift-aden.name;A gift from $FROMCOUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.gift-aden.desc;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has kindly entrusted to us the rule of lands including the Hadhramaut region! While unrest still exists in these lands, we will also be better equipped to resolve it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.gift-aden.opta;Joyous day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.punishment-fadhli.name;The Punishment of the Fadhli;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.punishment-fadhli.desc;In 1866, the British lost patience with the raids on Aden by Fadhli. A British force routed Fadhli's forces and destroyed so many villages that British historians did not find space in their writings to list them all. After this, Sultan Ahmad ibn `Abd Allah al-Fadli agreed to peaceful relations with his neighbors. A tradition of raiding thus ended, after heavy cost to Fadhli.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
cch.punishment-fadhli.opta;The heartbreak!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
