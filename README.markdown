Community Curated HFM
---------------------

[Obtain the latest release here.][RELEASE]

[RELEASE]: https://github.com/moretrim/ccHFM/releases/tag/v1.0.0

An unauthorised, unaffiliated effort to maintain the [Historical Flavour Mod][HFM] for Victoria II.
HFM development was [discontinued in 2020][discontinued], but this ambitious overhaul mod keeps a
special place in our hearts.

[HFM]: https://github.com/SighPie/HFM
[discontinued]: https://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/ins40a/hfm_historical_flavour_mod_unfinished_dev_files/

The main purpose of this project is to **preserve the HFM experience**. To best achieve this we are
mainly interested in doing the following in rough order of priority:

- defer major gameplay changes to parent mod [HPM]
- identify and correct shortcomings of HFM
- whenever it makes sense, submit these fixes and other issues to the parent mod
- whenever it makes sense, port HPM changes

[HPM]: https://github.com/arkhometha/Historical-Project-Mod

Note that this means **we are unlikely to accept feature requests**, especially those with a major
impact on gameplay. If possible, you should consider submitting those requests to [HPM] instead.

We also have a view on advancing from 1.27I (the latest stable release) as a basis, to the
unfinished 1.28 branch when development was halted. However this involves catching-up to version
0.4.5 of HPM (from 2019) that itself performed a big leap from previous major version 0.3,
undergoing some growing pains. Preliminary experience suggests that this is easier said than done,
and fixing bugs will take priority.

Features
--------

Due to our focus on bug fixes we produce many small changes. We organise them in two ways according
to your needs:

 * [**Chronological version history**][changelog], with a special highlight for flagship changes for
   each release
 * [**Breakdown of changes organised by game feature**][features]

[The history of editorial changes is collected separately.][editorial]
